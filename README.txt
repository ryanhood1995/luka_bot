This program is a Twitter Bot centered around the Dallas Maverick's Luka Doncic.
The Bot has the following functionality:
  1.) The Bot can respond to mentions.
    --- If another Twitter User mentions the Bot with any of the compatible keywords after the hash tag symbol, the bot
    will respond with the corresponding statistic.
  2.) The Bot can tweet stat lines after each game.
    --- After each game where Luka participated, the Bot will tweet the most important statistics.
  3.) The Bot can construct visualizations
    --- Full functionality to be determined later.
  4.) The Bot keeps its own Luka database, updating it after each game.

To run the program forever (restarting after crash), run forever.py.
To run the program until it crashes, run luka_bot.py.

This code was designed for a Windows machine.
